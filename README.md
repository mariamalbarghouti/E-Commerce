# E-Commerce Application

I have created this application to accomplish its functionality, regardless the UI.

I have used many principles for achieving goals for making this application **more reliable** and **maintainable**,
which provides the progressive evolution of the project.

## The Functionalities Which This Application Contains:

- Registration
  - Sign In
  - Sign Up
  - Sign Out 
- Adding Multiple Images
- CURD Operations

## For Achieving  These Functionality I Have Used:

- **Domain-Driven Design** Architecture.

- For Databse I have used Firestore, FireAuth and Firestorage by using the handy packages 
  - [cloud_firestore](https://pub.dev/documentation/cloud_firestore/latest/)
  - [firebase_auth](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_auth)
  - [firebase_storage](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_storage)
-  For Json Serializer, I have used [json_serializable](https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable) Package.
- Using Singleton Design Pattern for creating a single point if access to a particular instance, By Using [injectable](https://pub.dev/packages/injectable) Package.
- For Application "Logic" Layer, I have Used [get](https://pub.dev/packages/get) Package.
-  For data-classes or pattern matching, I Have Used [freezed](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed) Package.
-  For Applying Functional Programming, I Have Used [dartz](https://pub.dev/packages/dartz) Package.

## Assets

The `assets` directory houses images, fonts, and any other files you want to
include with your application.

The `assets/images` directory contains [resolution-aware
images](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/assets-and-images#resolution-aware).
